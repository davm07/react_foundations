What is the difference between Imperative vs Declarative Programming - Think about the difference between step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza vs just ordering a pizza.

Source code transformations (codemods)
And more! (check out these videos for inspiration)

btw we can think of props in React as the attributes of a HTML element.
Note: In React, data flows down the component tree. This is referred to as one-way data flow. State, which will be discussed in the next chapter, can be passed from parent to child components as props.
Props can be passed to components similarly to HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects and functions.
